# Shell Command Interpreter
A Linux shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Linux operating system. It provides a way for users to execute commands, navigate the file system, and perform various other tasks.Also, shell scripts are basically a series of Linux commands stored in a file that can be executed as a single command. 

## Architecture 
 * Interactive mode: the shell runs in a terminal window and waits for the user to enter a command. The user can enter commands one at a time, see the results, and then enter more commands.
 * Batch mode: the shell reads commands from a file, known as a script, and executes them in order. The script contains a series of commands that are executed automatically without any user interaction. This mode is useful for automating repetitive tasks, or for running a specific set of commands at a specific time.
